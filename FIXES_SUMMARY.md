# Smart Inventory Management System - Fixes Summary

## Date: June 18, 2025

## Issue Reported
The purchase order page at `http://localhost:8080/orders/purchase/add` was not working and needed investigation and fixing.

## Root Cause Analysis
Upon investigation, several template and entity field mapping issues were discovered that were preventing the application from rendering properly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. âœ… Fixed Stock Movement Validation Error
**Problem**: `StockMovement` entity required a `referenceNumber` field that wasn't being set
**Solution**: 
- Added `generateReferenceNumber()` method to `InventoryService`
- Updated all stock movement creation points to include auto-generated reference numbers
- Format: "SM" + timestamp + random suffix (e.g., "SM20250618034012345")

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/main/java/com/dawillygene/Smart/Inventory/Management/System/service/InventoryService.java`

### 2. âœ… Fixed Order Form Template Property Mismatches
**Problem**: Template was referencing non-existent entity fields
**Solutions**:
- Changed `expectedDate` to `expectedDeliveryDate` in orders form template
- Changed `supplier.contactEmail` to `supplier.email` 
- Removed non-existent `reference` field from the order form template

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/main/resources/templates/orders/form.html`

### 3. âœ… Fixed Product View Template Weight Property
**Problem**: Template was referencing `product.weightKg` instead of `product.weight`
**Solution**: Updated template to use the correct field name

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/main/resources/templates/products/view.html`

### 4. âœ… Fixed Product Quantity Reference in Orders Form
**Problem**: Template was trying to access `product.quantity` which doesn't exist on Product entity
**Solution**: Removed stock display from product dropdown (quantity is stored in separate Inventory entity)

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/main/resources/templates/orders/form.html`

## Current Status: âœ… FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### âœ… Verified Working Features:
